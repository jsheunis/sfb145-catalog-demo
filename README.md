# SFB145-catalog demo

Visit: https://jsheunis.github.io/sfb145-catalog-demo

This catalog demo was generated by the [DataLad Catalog](https://github.com/jsheunis/data-browser-from-metadata/tree/packaging) tool that is currently under development.

It allows generating a standalone browser-based user interface for [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org/) datasets by: (1) parsing Datalad-derived metadata, (2) translating the metadata into structured data understandable and renderable by the frontend, and (3) generating a VueJS-based frontend with which to interactively browse the dataset's metadata.
